# Mapping extreme gross vehicle weights using a Non-parametric Bayesian Network

 We deliver the first comprehensive spatial analysis of Mexicoâ€™s extreme gross vehicle weights (gvw) with 50-year and 1000-year return period. This information can serve as a basis for the reliability assessment and maintenance strategies of existing roads and bridges.
